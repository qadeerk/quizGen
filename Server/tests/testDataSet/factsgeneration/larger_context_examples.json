      "Input": "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes declarative programming where the focus is on what to solve rather than how to solve it. Functions in this paradigm are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. Pure functions, which have no side effects and depend only on their input arguments, are a cornerstone of functional programming. Key concepts include immutability, where data cannot be modified after it is created, and higher-order functions, which can take other functions as input or return them as output. This approach is used in languages like Haskell, Scala, and even JavaScript to improve code modularity, readability, and testability. Functional programming also incorporates concepts such as lazy evaluation, where computations are delayed until their results are actually needed, and recursion, a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. While functional programming offers many advantages, it can present a steep learning curve for developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms.",

      "Input": "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines elements of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to solve complex analytical problems. Data scientists often work with large datasets and utilize tools like Python, R, SQL, and machine learning libraries to process and analyze data. Key steps in the data science process include data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Visualization techniques are also critical, helping to communicate findings effectively through graphs, dashboards, and reports. Data science applications span diverse industries such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and social media, where predictive analytics and personalized recommendations are frequently employed. Despite its potential, data science faces challenges such as ensuring data quality, dealing with missing data, and maintaining data privacy and ethical considerations. The role of a data scientist requires both technical skills and a creative mindset to derive meaningful insights from data.",

      "Input": "Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures security and transparency. Each transaction in a blockchain is recorded as a block, and these blocks are linked together in chronological order to form a chain. Blockchain technology relies on cryptographic techniques to secure data and prevent unauthorized access. It eliminates the need for a central authority by enabling peer-to-peer networks and consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, to validate transactions. Popular applications of blockchain include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the technology has broader use cases, such as supply chain management, digital identity verification, and smart contracts. Blockchain ensures data integrity by making it nearly impossible to alter transaction history. However, it has limitations, including high energy consumption for some consensus mechanisms and scalability challenges. Despite these drawbacks, blockchain is considered a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various industries by enhancing trust, efficiency, and security.",
