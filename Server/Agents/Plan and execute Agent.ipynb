It simplifies the overall process through its structured development approach, dividing applications into components, services, and modules.\\n\\n3. **Integration with Back-end Systems**: Although Angular mainly focuses on front-end development, it can be paired with back-end technologies like Node.js or Python to create full-stack applications. This aspect allows smooth operation between the front and back ends of an application.\\n\\n4. **Mobile App Development**: Angular is also used to simplify web and mobile app development, combining end-to-end tooling, declarative templates, and dependency injection.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Large Codebases**: Angular promotes maintainability and scalability, which are particularly important for larger projects or when codebases need to be handled by multiple developers.

They collect related code into functional sets which can be combined with other sets to form an application. A module can include components, services, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule.\\n\\n   Every Angular application contains at least one module, known as the root module, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. Angular itself provides a set of modules, like `FormsModule`, `HttpClientModule`, and `RouterModule` that applications can use.\\n\\n2. **Components**: Components are fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They are classes that control a piece of the UI for the application. All Angular applications have at least a root component, but typically contain many more. Each component requires a supporting set of files: a CSS file (for the styles), an HTML file (for the template), a TypeScript file (for the logic), and a Spec file for testing.\\n\\n   Components contain the application’s logic to support the view within the template. This logic is implemented in a class file, which interacts with the HTML view through an API of properties and methods.\\n\\n3. **Services**: Services in Angular are classes where you define the methods that contain the application's business logic. Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other. Key principles of services include being a singleton, this means only one instance of a service exists during the lifetime of an application. It makes data visible to any part of the application, as long as there is a reference to the service.\\n\\n   You can use services to share code or features such as connecting to a database, handling exceptions, performing HTTP operations.\\n\\n4. **Directives**: Directives allow developers to attach behaviour to elements in the DOM. Essentially, they are functions that execute when the Angular compiler finds them in the DOM. They allow the developer to modify the HTML before it gets rendered.\\n\\n   There are three types of directives in Angular:\\n   - Component directives: These are directives with a template.\\n   - Structural directives: These can change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. Example: *ngFor and *ngIf.\\n   - Attribute directives: These can change the appearance or behaviour of an element. Example: ngStyle and ngClass.\")]}\n",
